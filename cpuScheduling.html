          <div id="info">
            First Come First Serve (FCFS) is an operating system scheduling
            algorithm that automatically executes queued requests and processes
            in order of their arrival. It is the easiest and simplest CPU
            scheduling algorithm. In this type of algorithm, processes which
            requests the CPU first get the CPU allocation first. This is managed
            with a FIFO queue. The full form of FCFS is First Come First Serve.
            <br />
            <br />
            As the process enters the ready queue, its PCB (Process Control
            Block) is linked with the tail of the queue and, when the CPU
            becomes free, it should be assigned to the process at the beginning
            of the queue. <br />

          <div id="info">
            Shortest Job First (SJF) is an algorithm in which the process having
            the smallest execution time is chosen for the next execution. This
            scheduling method can be preemptive or non-preemptive. It
            significantly reduces the average waiting time for other processes
            awaiting execution. The full form of SJF is Shortest Job First.

          <div id="title">Round Robin Scheduling</div>
          <div id="info">
            The name of this algorithm comes from the round-robin principle,
            where each person gets an equal share of something in turns. It is
            the oldest, simplest scheduling algorithm, which is mostly used for
            multitasking. <br />
            <br />
            In Round-robin scheduling, each ready task runs turn by turn only in
            a cyclic queue for a limited time slice. This algorithm also offers
            starvation free execution of processes.

          <div id="title">Priority Scheduling</div>
          <div id="info">
            Priority Scheduling is a method of scheduling processes that is
            based on priority. In this algorithm, the scheduler selects the
            tasks to work as per the priority.
            <br /><br />
            The processes with higher priority should be carried out first,
            whereas jobs with equal priorities are carried out on a round-robin
            or FCFS basis. Priority depends upon memory requirements, time
            requirements, etc.
